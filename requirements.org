* My Emacs config specification

The Emacs lisp code in my config shall be divided into two categories:
startup elisp code and Just-In-Time (JIT) elisp code. Startup elisp
code is loaded when Emacs starts, and JIT elisp code only loads when
a file corresponding to a respective mode is opened. The purpose of this
is to reduce load time in Emacs as much as possible.

* UI/UX
The menu bar shall be hidden.

The tool bar shall be hidden.

The scroll bar shall be hidden.

Line numbers shall be displayed in all modes, except in any mode that
is a shell (e.g. shell-mode, vterm, eshell, etc.)


* Programming
For programming languages with a REPL, the keypress "C-c C-z" shall
open a REPL in another window if a REPL process was started.

Imported objects/functions that are not used shall be greyed out.

When the point in Emacs is on a function name, the keypress "M-." goes
directly to the function definition.

When the point in Emacs is on a function name, the keypress
"C-c C-d d" shall fetch the documentation for that function.
